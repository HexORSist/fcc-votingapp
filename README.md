# Free Code Camp Voting App

## Overview

Voting App demonstrating the use of MEAN stack devloplement. Jquery, Javascript, ExpressJS and Mongoose where used to develope this app.  The coding is very rough and not much time was spent trying to improve because its my first effort using full stack developement.  Hoping that future stack developement will emplemint REACT/Flux for better coding/structure techniques.

The [Voting App](https://fcc-votingapp-hexorsist.c9.io/login) version).


### Starting the App

The app is simple it has a login screen for authentacting the poll creater.  modification is also allowed on the poll through the 'modify poll' button.  Once the poll is genertated or shared it produces a url for ranking the catagories to non-authentacated users.
