# Free Code Camp Voting App

## Overview

Voting App demonstrating the use of MEAN stack developement. Jquery, Javascript, ExpressJS and Mongoose where used to develope this app.  The coding is very rough and not much time was spent trying to improve or make pretty because its my first effort using full stack developement.  Hoping that future stack developement will implement REACT/Flux for better coding/structure techniques.

The [Voting App](https://fcc-votingapp-hexorsist.c9.io/login) version).

### Starting the App

The app is simple it has a login screen for authenticating the poll creater.  Modification is also allowed on the poll through the 'modify poll' button.  Once the poll is generated or shared it produces a url for ranking the catagories in a non-authenticated fashion.

### License

It's based off of clementinejs so whatever rights that have.
